- Started scoping and implementing wjbetech-dashboard project: created and updated spec files under /home/will/openclaw/apps/wjbetech-dashboard/docs/spec/ including product brief, design system, IA, UI patterns, data model, integrations, API contracts, security, quality bar, delivery playbook.
- Implemented design system tokens (light/dark) with Inter font, created /src/design/tokens/{light.json,dark.json} and /src/styles/theme.css with CSS variables, elevation, layout, motion, skeleton utilities.
- Added UI components: Skeleton, EmptyState, ToastsProvider; updated DashboardPage to use provider and EmptyState; added small CSS utilities (.bg-level-1/2/3, .btn-motion, .skeleton).
- Scaffolded backend: backend/src/index.ts (health route) and backend/.env.example; added initial DB migration backend/db/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql.
- Multiple CI fixes to stabilize workflows: .gitmodules entry, change npm ci -> npm install in some steps, ensured devDependencies installed for unit job (npm install --include=dev), updated tsconfig to include backend, regenerated backend/package-lock.json.
- Ran iterative PR workflow fixes: created many branches/PRs (e.g., feat/design-elevation, feat/layout-grid, feat/motion-baseline, feat/skeleton-strategy, chore/fix-workflows-conflicts, chore/fix-heartbeat-watcher, chore/ci-use-npm-install, chore/ci-install-devdeps, chore/auto-backend-project-setup, etc.) and monitored CI, re-ran failing jobs, and applied focused fixes.
- Ongoing: prioritizing stabilizing the CI build and unit test suite so PRs can be merged reliably. Current active work: diagnosing/fixing PR #135 unit failures and ensuring a single clean passing CI run is reflected in GitHub.

Notes:
- Operated mainly in /workspace and /home/will/openclaw/apps/wjbetech-dashboard paths; created many files under /workspace/apps/wjbetech-dashboard/src and backend.
- Authentication for pushing required gh credential helper and valid GITHUB_TOKEN; resolved during session with environment updates.

Next recommended steps (short):
- Fix root npm run build errors and any remaining TS or import issues preventing unit tests from passing in CI.
- Once tests are stable, continue through TODO.md tasks with one small PR per item.
